1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that develops personalized financial plans for clients, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company wanted me to address security vulnerabilities in their software, particularly by ensuring secure communication during data transfers. Their primary requirement was to implement secure coding protocols, including adding a cryptographic hash algorithm and enabling HTTPS for secure communication.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I successfully identified vulnerabilities in the software related to secure communication and implemented solutions like enabling HTTPS and using cryptographic hashing. Coding securely is vital because it protects sensitive data and reduces the risk of cyberattacks. Strong software security enhances a company's reputation, builds trust with clients, and ensures long-term operational stability.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Everything went smoothly and nothing was challenging; the weeks of hard studying paid off. 

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


I increased layers of security by implementing HTTPS for secure communication and using SHA-256 cryptographic hashing for data verification. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and manual code reviews to assess vulnerabilities and apply mitigation techniques based on best practices for secure coding.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


I ensured the code and software were functional and secure by running the application and verifying its output through manual testing and checksum verification. After refactoring, I used the OWASP Dependency-Check tool to scan for new vulnerabilities and confirmed that no additional security issues were introduced.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used GeeksForGeeks and StackOverflow to solve errors that occured during testing. My program refused to start on several occassions, and each of them was fixed with the help of the Stack Overflow and GeeksForGeeks websites, which offer a vast array of solved issues that other developers encountered. 

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I could show future employers the implementation of secure communication using HTTPS with a self-signed certificate, as well as the integration of SHA-256 for checksum verification. Additionally, I would highlight my ability to perform vulnerability assessments using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and demonstrate how I applied secure coding practices to mitigate risks.
